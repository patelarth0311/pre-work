App Idea
  I would create an application that offers insights into the user's music listening activity.
  Users can view their top songs, artists, albums, and genres. The insights would include information, such as 
  number of the times the media or artist was played and their total listening time. Users can also view
  trends in their listening activity.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was receiving a NSUnknownKeyException error soon after introducing the stack. After reading, I realized this was because one of its outlet collection
linked to a UI element that no longer existed.
